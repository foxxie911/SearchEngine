### Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented a basic search engine using dummy site data. This project covers all the basic functionality of a search engine. I have used HITS and PageRanking to rank the sites. Two different search functions are used. One of which shows the sites where contents contain all the query term and another one shows the sites where contents contain only one of the search term.

### Language & Library

This project is implemented in Python. It also uses multiple Python libraries to ease the implementing process. These libraries are:

- Pandas
- NetworkX
- nltk
- string
