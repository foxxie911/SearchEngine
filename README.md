### Project Overview

In this project, I have implemented a basic search engine using dummy site data. This project covers all the basic functionality of a search engine. I have used HITS and PageRanking algorithms to suggest sites which can also be used to compare between this two algorithms. Here two different search function is implemented. One of which shows the site which contents contains all the query term and another one shows the sites which contents contains only one of the search term.

### Language & Library

This project is implemented in Python. It also uses multiple Python library to ease the implementing process. These libraries are:

- Pandas
- NetworkX

- string
